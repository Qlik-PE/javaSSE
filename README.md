# Java Server-Side Extension Plugin Server

This project is derived from the java-based "basic example"
[qlik-oss/servier-side-extension/examples/java/basic_example](https://github.com/qlik-oss/server-side-extension/tree/master/examples/java/basic_example) which is part of a larger collection of examples for
various languages [qlik-oss/server-side-extension](https://github.com/qlik-oss/server-side-extension).

Note that while this example is derived from the above mentioned "basic example", you will find
very little similarity. The code has been extensively refactored to allow for a more object-oriented 
approach to implementation of a plugin, allow for more reuse, and to isolate to the greatest
degree possible the gRPC-based server logic from the implementation of SSE functions. Essentially, SSE "function" logic that runs as a plugin has been isolated from the server logic itself.


## This is a placeholder. More details to come.
